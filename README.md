## Local running instructions if the link does not work

To run this code locally, make sure you have npm (node package manager) installed,
after this, open the WEBMASTER-24-25 directory, and run "npm install" to install all
relevant packages to getting this website to run locally. After that run "npm run dev"
and then navigate to a browser where you can visit the localhost port that is returned in
console, the default location is http://localhost:5173/.

There is currently a bug in only the vite/npm development with multipage sites using 
react JS' router package where reloading a page other than the landing page will result
in nothing rendering, in this case, navigate back to the localhost landing page by typing 
the localhost url into the search bar of your browser in order to get the site to load again.
